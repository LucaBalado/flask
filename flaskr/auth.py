from flaskr.db import get_db

bp = Blueprint('auth', __name__, url_prefix='/auth')

This creates a Blueprint named 'auth'. Like the application object, the blueprint needs to know where itâ€™s defined, so __name__ is passed as the second argument. The url_prefix will be prepended to all the URLs associated with the blueprint.

Import and register the blueprint from the factory using app.register_blueprint(). Place the new code at the end of the factory function before returning the app.

    app.register_blueprint(auth.bp)

    return app
